# I have created few tables and drawn relations between tables like one to one, one to many, and many to many.

# ONE TO ONE RELATIONSHIP
# I have created a "EMP" and "DEPT" tables and designed in such a way that only one employee belongs to one department.

# ONE TO MANY RELATIONSHIP
# I have created a "CUSTOMER" and "ORDERS" tables and designed in such a way that one customer can have multiple numbers of orders.

# MANY TO MANY RELATIONSHIP
# I have created a "STUDENT" and "COURSE" tables and designed in such a way that many number of students can study in any number of courses.
